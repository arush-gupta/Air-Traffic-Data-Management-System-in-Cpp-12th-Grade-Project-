# Air Traffic Data Management System

proapip4 (Pro-Airport Information Protocol V4) is a project I created during my 12th grade (2015) as part of my introduction to computer science. It showcases my initial understanding of computer science concepts, e.g., object-oriented programming, file handling, and the code is posted as-is, without modification, to show how I approached the problem at that time.

## Features
- **Search Flight Records** by flight code or departure time.
- **Modify Flight Records** (admin access only).
- **Insert New Flight Records** into the database.
- **Delete Flight Records** (admin access only).

## Limitations
- Simple structure and may not follow modern coding practices.
- Lacks optimization and advanced features.
- Minimal error handling and input validation.

## Why Share This Project?
I wanted to include this project in my GitHub portfolio to show my early interest in computer science and air traffic management, as well as to showcase my progression as a developer over the years.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- A terminal or IDE that supports C++.

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Execute the program to interact with the flight database.
3. Admin login is required for modifying, inserting, or deleting records.
